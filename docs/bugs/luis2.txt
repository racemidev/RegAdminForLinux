It seems better but the test case I'm looking at still fails.  Here's
the key on the left side of the diff:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\1425\ControlSet001\Control\criticaldevicedatabase\gendisk]
"service"="disk"
"classguid"="{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}"
"upperfilters"="crcdisk"

and here's the key on the right side:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\virgin\ControlSet001\Control\CriticalDeviceDatabase\gendisk]
"Service"="disk"
"ClassGUID"="{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}"

Here's the current output from rra_registry_diff:

DELETE_VALUE(\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\ControlSet001\Control\criticaldevicedatabase\gendisk,
classguid, SZ, {4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318})
DELETE_VALUE(\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\ControlSet001\Control\criticaldevicedatabase\gendisk,
service, SZ, disk)
DELETE_VALUE(\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\ControlSet001\Control\criticaldevicedatabase\gendisk,
upperfilters, SZ, crcdisk)

What I'd like to see is only one DELETE_VALUE line for the upperfilters value.

I understand that it might be tricky to know if one can do a case
insensitive compare of the values because the case might be
significant in some cases but most of the time it's not.  Perhaps a
switch/option could help?  Then depending on the kind of differences
one is looking for, one would know if it matters and this case, I
would've asked for case insensitive comparison of values.

Thanks for the help on this.
